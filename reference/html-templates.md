## HTML Templates

A reference for HTML templates.

## <template>

The ```<template>``` element holds or HTML that is not to be rendered immediately, but can be instantiated during runtime using JavaScript.

The parser does process the contents of the ```<template>``` while loading the page, but only to ensure it's content is valid.

The ```<template>``` element also comes with the ```content``` property. This is read-only and contains the DOM subtree represented by the template.
